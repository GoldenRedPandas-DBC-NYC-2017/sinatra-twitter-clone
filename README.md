## Summary

We're going to build a simple version of Twitter.  

## Your application should have:
 1. User registration page (full name, username, email, password)
 2. User can create, update and delete tweets. Don't forget about character length restriction for tweets.
 3. User can follow and have many followers.
 4. User profile page displays the number of tweets, followings and followers.
 5. Also, create a page to list all the registered users. This would be a great place to find new friends, see their pages, and eventually follow them.
